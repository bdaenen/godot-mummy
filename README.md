# GodotMummy

This is a port of [PyraMummy](https://github.com/bdaenen/pyramummy/blob/master/README.md) from [Kontra](https://github.com/straker/kontra) to [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot)

The main purpose is to get more familiar with the Godot engine, while also having a clearly-scoped game to build. Additionally it allows me to improve upon the original game as the harsh restrictions of the original game no longer apply.

Every push to master automatically deploys to https://mummy.benn0.be, but as it's a WIP not everything might work as intended yet.
